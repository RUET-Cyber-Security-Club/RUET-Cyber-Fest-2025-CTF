# RUET Cyber Fest 2025 — CTF Challenges

Welcome! This repository contains Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges prepared for RUET Cyber Fest 2025. It’s organized for learning, practice, and hosting during the event. You’ll find challenges across multiple categories (primarily Web and Pwn), each self-contained with its own run instructions.

> Note: These challenges are for educational purposes.

## Flags & Writeups

- Any `flag.txt` or similar files inside the repo are event assets or placeholders; treat them as part of the challenge environment, not spoilers.
- Please avoid publishing full solutions before or during the event. After the event, writeups are welcome—organize them under a separate `writeups/` folder if added.

## Contributing / Maintenance

- Keep each challenge self-contained with its own Docker and run instructions.
- If you add new challenges:
  - Include a brief `README.md` with goals, category, and run steps.
  - Provide minimal hints and clear intended behavior.
  - Ensure portability (Windows + Linux) via Docker where possible.

For questions or event coordination, reach out to the RUET Cyber Fest organizers or the CTF challenge maintainers.

Enjoy hacking and learning!
